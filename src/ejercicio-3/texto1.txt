Using the TypeScript Compiler
In this chapter, I show you how to use the TypeScript compiler, which is responsible for transforming
TypeScript code into JavaScript that can be executed by browsers or the Node.js runtime. I also describe the
compiler configuration options that are most useful for TypeScript development, including those that are
used with the web application frameworks covered in Part 3 of this book.
